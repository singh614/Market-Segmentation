# Market Segmentation using KMeans Clustering

## 📑 Project Overview
This project leverages **KMeans clustering** to perform market segmentation, identifying distinct customer groups based on their behavioral patterns. The insights from this analysis enable businesses to tailor marketing strategies effectively to target specific customer segments.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Optimal Clusters**: Utilized the **Elbow Method** to determine the ideal number of clusters for segmentation.
- **Data Visualization**: Created detailed visualizations to represent customer clusters and their characteristics.
- **Actionable Insights**: Provided data-driven recommendations for improving marketing strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `scikit-learn`: For clustering (KMeans) and analysis
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization

## 📈 Methodology
1. **KMeans Clustering**:
   - Implemented KMeans clustering to segment the data into distinct groups.
   - Assigned each data point to a cluster and analyzed group characteristics.

2. **Finding Optimal Clusters**:
   - Applied the **Elbow Method** by plotting the sum of squared distances (SSE) against the number of clusters.
   - Selected the optimal cluster count where the "elbow" occurs in the plot.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plotted customer clusters for easy interpretation using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Elbow Curve**: Demonstrates the optimal number of clusters.
- **Cluster Scatter Plots**: Displays segmented customer groups based on key features.
